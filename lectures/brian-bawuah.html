			<p>
				Brian is an employee at Rockstars IT and is involved in virtual reality
				prototyping.
			</p>

			<p>
				The prototyping process begins with initial sketches on whiteboards or paper.
				Then, Brian creates a cardboard or paper prototype using Arduino, and also
				utilizes Blender for further prototyping. When it comes to converting the
				prototype to a web-based format, Brian suggests using the HTML canvas element or
				the Three.js JavaScript library.
			</p>

			<p>
				To generate (3D) avatars, Brian uses a service called Ready Player Me, a
				third-party software that generates avatars based on a user's picture. This tool
				can be helpful for creating personalized virtual representations.
			</p>

			<p>
				Furthermore, Brian explains the significance of the UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
				protocol in real-time applications, such as video games. UDP sends packets
				continuously, irrespective of whether they reach the destination or when they do
				so. This constant transmission is beneficial for maintaining real-time
				interaction. I didn't really get this part but he seemed passionate about it :)
