				Servin works for Level 30 Wizards, a creative digital studio, as the lead frontend
				developer. Where needed he also works as a fullstack developer. In this college,
				he talks about 3D on the web and Three.js.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the context of 3D and web development, the HTML
				<code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element is commonly used to build 3D scenes by
				painting specific pixels.
			</p>
			<p>
				WebGL is a JavaScript API that allows rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics
				directly in web browsers, eliminating the need for plugins. It seamlessly
				integrates with web standards and enables GPU-accelerated physics, image
				processing, and effects within the web page canvas.
			</p>
			<p>
				Different types of cameras can be used in 3D scenes, such as the perspective
				camera and orthographic camera.
			</p>
			<p>
				Various types of lights can be implemented to enhance the 3D scene, including
				ambient light, directional light, point light, and spot light.
			</p>
			<p>
				WebGPU is a newer and improved version of WebGL that is still in development. It
				offers enhanced capabilities but is not widely supported by browsers yet.
			</p>
			<p>
				WebXR is a technology aimed at creating websites for virtual reality (VR) and
				augmented reality (AR) devices. Similar to WebGPU, it is still in development and
				not widely supported by browsers at present.
