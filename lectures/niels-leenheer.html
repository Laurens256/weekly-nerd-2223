				<h1>Project Fugu: Bridging the Gap Between Native and Web Applications</h1>
				<small>Niels Leenheer - april 2023</small>
			</header>
			<p>
				Among developers, web applications have gained significant popularity due to their
				ease of development. However, there&#39;s always been limitations to what is
				possible and what isn&#39;t. Examples of this include accessing the user&#39;s
				file system or hardware peripherals like printers or bluetooth devices. This
				limitation has been primarily due to security reasons.
			</p>

			<p>
				Enter Project Fugu, an initiative aimed at closing the gap between native- and web
				applications. Project Fugu aims to provide web applications with access to a wide
				range of (hardware) functionalities, making web-applications more powerful and
				viable than ever before.

				<h2>File system api</h2>
				<p>
					An example where Project Fugu comes in handy is the File System Access API.
					Traditionally, web applications were unable to access a user&#39;s file system
					due to security restrictions. However, with the File System Access API, web
					applications can now securely access a user&#39;s file system, opening up
					possibilities for web-based text editors, image editors, and other applications
					that require file system access. This breakthrough has even made a web-based
					version of Photoshop possible, something that was impossible not even a few
					years ago.
				</p>

				<h2>Hardware peripherals</h2>
				<p>
					Project Fugu also extends to interacting with hardware peripherals, such as
					printers, barcode scanners, and cash drawers. These functionalities were
					previously only available to native applications, but now web applications can
					also utilize them securely. Previously, a native application would need to be
					developed for each different platform, but with Project Fugu, web applications
					can be developed once and work across most platforms.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2>Security</h2>
				<p>
					Despite the expanded capabilities, that Project Fugu offers, Niels believes that
					it is safe to use. Unlike native applications, which typically have unrestricted
					access to a user&#39;s device, web applications using Project Fugu
					functionalities are still subject to the security measures of the browser. By
					default, web applications do not have access to hardware functionalities, and
					explicit user consent is required to grant access. This makes it arguably safer
					to use Project Fugu in web applications compared to downloading a native app and
					granting it unrestricted access to the hardware.
