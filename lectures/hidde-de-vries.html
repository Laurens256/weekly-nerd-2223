				<h1>Dialogs and Modals</h1>
				<small>Hidde de Vries - april 2023</small>
			</header>

			<p>
				Modals and dialogs are commonly used on websites to present important information
				or to prompt the user to perform an action. When using these elements it&#39;s
				important to use these them correctly to ensure a positive user experience. In his
				lecture, frontend developer and accessibility expert Hidde de Vries talks about
				the use of modals and dialogs and provides useful definitions and tips for their
				implementation.

			<h2>Modal vs. non-modal</h3>
			<p>
				A modal is a type of dialog that appears on top of the main content of a website
				and requires the user&#39;s attention. While a modal is displayed, the user cannot
				interact with the main content of the website. On the other hand, a non-modal
				dialog is displayed on top of the main content, but the user can still interact
				with the website while the dialog is open. It&#39;s important to make sure the
				website&#39;s main content is inert while a modal is open to prevent user
				confusion or interaction with elements outside the modal.
			</p>
			<p>
				Modals and dialogs can be dismissed either explicitly, by clicking a button, or
				through a light dismiss, such as clicking outside or hovering outside the element.
			</p>
		</div>

			<h2>Z-index and top layer</h3>
			<p>
				CSS&#39;s Z-index property is used to determine the stacking order of elements,
				with higher values appearing on top of lower values. However, the relatively new
				top layer feature ensures that content inside the top layer is always displayed on
				top, regardless of the z-index of other elements. The top layer can be useful to
				place modals or other dialogs on top of the main content of the website.
			</p>
			<p>
				Backdrops are often used in modals to create a semi-transparent overlay behind the
				dialog, highlighting its importance and slightly hiding the page&#39;s contents.
				Elements inside the top layer have this backdrop built in. This backdrop can be
				styled using the <code>::backdrop</code> pseudo selector in CSS.
			</p>

		</div>

			<h2>Keyboard focus traps</h2>
			<p>
				Keyboard focus traps can be used to prevent the user from interacting with the
				main content of the website while the modal or dialog is open. Focus traps work by
				making elements outside the modal un-tabbable. This ensures that the user&#39;s
				attention remains inside the modal. It&#39;s important to remove the focus trap
				once the modal is closed, so the rest of the website becomes tabbable again.
