				<h1>Making websites work for everyone</h1>
				<small>Aaron Gustafson - March 2023</small>

				Aaron is the Principal Accessibility Innovation Strategist at Microsoft. In this
				college, he discusses accessibility for the web and how to make websites work for
				everyone.

				<h2>How can we make our websites work for everyone</h2>
				<p>
					When developing websites, it's crucial to consider the diverse range of user
					networks and conditions that exist, including wifi, hardline, and mobile
					connections. The web experience is not homogenous as we may imagine, as
					lower-class devices may perform worse / differently than higher-class ones.
					Therefore, to make websites work for everyone, we need to take these factors
					into account.
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				A good practice to ensure website accessibility is through progressive enhancement
				or graceful degradation. This means starting with the most basic functionality and
				then building upon it. By developing this way, we ensure that the core
				functionality of the website will work for anyone, regardless of their device,
				while providing additional features for those with more advanced devices.
			</p>

			<p>
				A common metaphor for progressive enhancement is the escalator. Just like how an
				escalator always works, even if it's not moving, a well-made website should also
				function even if certain elements, such as JavaScript, are not enabled. The
				website may not be as enjoyable without these advanced features, but it should
				still be functional for all users.

				<h2>Steps when developing for the web</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Focus on what matters: It's important to prioritize what'&#39;'s most
						important for your website and focus on those elements first. This will help
						you stay on track and reduce unnecessary complexity.
					</li>
					<li>
						Write it out, then read it back: Before diving into coding, take some time to
						plan out your website and write out your ideas. Then, read your plan back to
						make sure everything makes sense and you haven'&#39;'t missed anything
						important or overcomplicated things.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use semantic code: Semantic code uses HTML tags that accurately describe the
						content they contain, making it easier for all users to understand and use
						your website.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use design to communicate your intent: Good design can help communicate the
						purpose and message of your website to visitors. Use common design patterns
						and make sure your design conveys your intent.
					</li>
					<li>
						Consider your design choices and how they impact user experience: Design
						choices can have a big impact on how users interact with your site. Think
						about things like layout, color choices and typography. Think about how these
						elements of a website can affect usability and accessibility.
					</li>
					<li>
						Think about the different ways people might interact with your site: People
						will access your site from a variety of devices and browsers with varying
						network speeds. Make sure your site is responsive and accessible on different
						platforms.
					</li>
					<li>
						Iterate: Finally, remember that development is an iterative process. Don&#39;t
						be afraid to kill your darlings and improve your site as you go.
					</li>
