				<h2>Sophie Koonin</h2>
				<p>
					Sophie Koonin, a web engineering lead at Monzo, aims to revive the quirky and
					humorous website styles of the 2000s. She showcased a website she built using
					modern and accessible HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while incorporating the
					aesthetics of the 2000s.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sophie emphasizes the importance of accommodating user preferences, such as
					disabling animations and autoplay, utilizing media queries like
					prefers-reduced-motion, and employing the HTML source attribute to load static
					versions of gifs/videos. In a demo, Sophie showed us how to create a 200s
					WordArt effect using modern CSS techniques she used the CSS
					<code>background-clip: text;</code> property and applyied a drop shadow to the
					wrapper for a simulated 3D effect.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sophie also highlights the evolution of web practices, mentioning how audio
					autoplay is no longer favored and opting for audio to be &quot;opt-in&quot;
					only. She recalls the use of webrings to interlink websites and shares her
					creation of a webring for silly/funny websites, implemented through Google
					Sheets. Additionally, Sophie developed a guestbook using Mastodon, a federated
					social network, as an alternative to leaving messages on websites.

				<h2>Adam Argyle</h2>
				<p>
					Adam Argyle talked to us about CSS variable fonts, which contain multiple
					variations of a font within a single font file. By using CSS, developers can
					modify font attributes such as weight, width, slant, and morphing. Argyle also
					talks about the LCH color model, which provides a more accurate representation
					of human-perceived color compared to RGB. LCH stands for lightness (L), chroma
					(C), and hue (H). To create a palette / color in this style, Adam showed us this
					website he made
					<a target="_blank" href="https://gradient.style">https://gradient.style</a>

				<h2>Debugging with DevTools</h2>
				<p>
					Browser devtools is a tool that assists developers in troubleshooting various
					aspects of web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and network
					requests. The Chrome (?) devtools team has been working hard to ensure that the
					tooling provides a good user experience, not just by exposing information but
					also by presenting it in an easily understandable manner.
				</p>
				<p>
					DevTools offers CSS authoring hints, displaying reasons for inactive styles or
					selectors and indicating specificity. The rapid pace of CSS feature development
					requires DevTool developers to keep up. Some new features in DevTools include
					color debugging/conversion, animation timing, container queries, and
					scroll-driven animations.
