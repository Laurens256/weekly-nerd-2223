				<h1>Accessible, Creative Development</h1>
				<small>Cyd Stumpel - March 2023</small>
			</header>

			<p>
				Website accessibility is a critical consideration for web developers to ensure
				that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can access and use websites.
				Unfortunately, many award-winning websites are still inaccessible.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this lecture, Cyd Stumpel, creative freelance developer, discussed the
				importance of website accessibility and how to make websites accessible. She will
				also discuss common mistakes that developers and designers make when creating
				websites and how to avoid them.
			</p>

				<h2>Common mistakes</h2>
				<p>
					Some common mistakes that contribute to inaccessibility include hiding focus
					states, using excessive moving text, badly formatted HTML and not respecting
					<code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> and similar media queries. All of these
					mistakes can lead to a less pleasurable experience for users, especially those
					with disabilities.

				<h2>Smooth scroll libraries</h2>
				<p>
					Something that lots of &quot;creative&quot; websites do is remove the native
					scroll functionality and replace it with the scrolling functionality of a smooth
					scroll library. This is often done to create a more stylistic experience for
					users. However, these scroll libraries often disrupt the native functionality of
					the browser, which can make it more difficult to interact with the website. An
					example Cyd mentioned is the &quot;find&quot; function (<code>ctrl / cmd</code>
					+ <code>f</code>) which most browsers have. This function allows users to search
					for a specific word on the page. When native scroll is enabled, when a keyword
					is found on the page, the browser scroll down to the keyword automatically. When
					native scroll is disabled however, the browser is not able to scroll down to the
					keyword. This leads to the user seeing not being able to jump to a keyword by
					searching for it.
				</p>
				<p>
					A (more) valid alternative to common scrolling libraries, is
					<a href="https://lenis.studiofreight.com/">Lenis</a>. Lenis is a scrolling
					library which allows the developer to control the scrolling experience more
					freely while still keeping most functionality provided by native scroll.
				</p>

				<h2>Closing words</h2>
				<p>
					To make a website accessible, developers should rethink their defaults. They
					should consider and when possible, not interfere the native functionality the
					browser provides. By taking these steps, developers can create websites that are
					accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities.
