				<h1>Triple's tech stack</h1>
				<small>Chanel - May 2023</small>
			</header>

			<p>
				Chanel is a frontend developer at
				<a href="https://www.wearetriple.com/en">Triple</a>, a full service digital agency
				located in Alkmaar. She graduated from CMD at the Amsterdam University of Applied
				Sciences in 2018. In this talk, Chanel told us about Triple's tech stack and their
				motivation for using certain technologies.
			</p>

			<div>
				<h2>Git</h2>
				<p>
					Git is an important tool at Triple. It's used for version control and makes it
					easier for multiple developers to collaborate on projects. The workflow in Git
					at Triple is as follows:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Create a branch</li>
					<li>Commit & push</li>
					<li>Create a pull request</li>
					<li>Push to the main branch</li>
					<li>Deploy!</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2>Npm</h2>
				<p>
					At Triple, when working on Node projects, developers are allowed to use packages
					from the Node Package Manager (npm). Using packages inside your project is
					something that should be thought over carefully because it could allow for
					vulnerabilities in your project. When using npm packages, it's important to
					check the following:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>When was the last update?</li>
					<li>How many downloads does it have?</li>
					<li>How many contributors does it have?</li>
					<li>How big is the package?</li>
					<li>What are it's dependencies?</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2>Vanilla, library or framework</h2>
				<p>
					When starting a project, one of the most important things to decide on is
					whether to use vanilla Javascript, or use a library or framework. Sometimes
					vanilla Javascript is the better option, but sometimes using a library or
					framework can help you prevent reinvent the wheel.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the past, Triple used Angular a lot. Nowadays, they use React and Next.js.
					For projects where SEO (search engine optimilization) isn't imporant, React is a
					good option. When using React, content is rendered on the client which isn't
					good for SEO, but can give your website an "appy" feel. If SEO is important,
					Next.js is a better option. Next.js renders content on the server, either during
					build time or during runtime, which is better for SEO.
				</p>

				<p>
					Triple is currently preparing to switch to Svelte. Svelte is a Javascript
					framework that is faster, lighter and easier to use than React. It's also easier
					to learn for developers who are new to Javascript frameworks since it's closer
					to vanilla Javacript.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2>Typescript</h2>
				<p>
					At Triple, Typescript is used a lot. Typescript is a superset of Javascript,
					which means that all valid Javascript is valid Typescript. Typescript
					<s>adds</s> enforces types in Javascript. Using Typescript helps allow
					developers to find bugs <em>before</em> they get to the browser. Below is some
					example code highlighting the differences between Javascript and Typescript.
				</p>
				<pre>
				<code>
// Javascript
function add(a, b) {
	return a + b;
}

add(1, 2); // 3
add('1', '2'); // '12'

// Typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
	return a + b;
}

add(1, 2); // 3
add('1', '2'); // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
				</code>
			</pre>
				<p>
					Of course, Typescript does a lot more than simple stuff like this. To read more
					about Typescript, check out their
					<a
						href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/"
						aria-label="typescript documentation"
						>docs</a
					>
				</p>
			</div>
			.

				<h2>CSS</h2>
				<p>
					At Triple, they use SASS, a CSS preprocessor. SASS is a superset of CSS, which
					means that all valid CSS is valid SASS. SASS adds features like variables,
					nesting, mixins, inheritance, etc. Below is some example code showing why SASS
					can be a useful too to write less CSS.
				</p>

				<pre>
				<code>
<!-- SASS loop-->
@for $i from 1 through 3 {
	.item-#{$i} { width: 2em * $i; }
}

<!-- output -->
.item-1 {
	width: 2em;
}
.item-2 {
	width: 4em;
}
.item-3 {
	width: 6em;
}
				</code>
			</pre>
			</div>

				<h2>Azure & Azure DevOps</h2>
				<p>
					Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft. Azure DevOps is a
					service that provides developers with tools to help them with their development
					process. At Triple, they use Azure DevOps for their pipelines. A pipeline is a
					virtual machine that runs your code and checks it against the standards. Then
					builds it so it's ready for deployment. Triple uses three environments for
					testing:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Development: for testing and developing</li>
					<li>Acceptance: for testing with the client</li>
					<li>Production: the live website</li>
				</ol>
