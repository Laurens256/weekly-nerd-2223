				<h1>Mostly stuff about Chazz</h1>
				<small>Chazz Mannering - March 2023</small>
			</header>
			<p>
				Chazz Mannering is 26 years old. He completed his pre-university education (HAVO)
				and then pursued a 1-year course in ICT before enrolling in CMD (Communication and
				Multimedia Design). He jokingly refers to himself as having &quot;eternal student
				syndrome.&quot; Chazz started his journey at CMD in 2017 and completed all the
				available tech tracks. In the meantime, he worked as a Frontend Developer.
			</p>
			<p>
				CF, the company he works at, focuses on unraveling the complexities of the world
				through data, design, and technology. Chazz contributed to the creation of a
				Corona Dashboard and gained experience in data visualization and data-driven
				experiences.
			</p>
			<p>
				CF has a team of 40 employees with various disciplines, including data analysts,
				frontend developers, designers, and UX specialists. Weekly team meetings and
				tech/design reviews are conducted. Their tech stack primarily consists of React
				and Next for frontend development.
			</p>
			<p>
				At CF, Chazz started by taking a one-week React Course. He then worked on various
				projects such as the prototype day gallery, artmile AR, Globalance, Experiments
				page, Powers of Ten, and Patterns of Cairo. The prototype day is an annual
				internal project, similar to a hackathon, where participants receive a task and
				spend the entire day working on it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Chazz conducted extensive testing for the use of Augmented Reality (AR) on the
				web, exploring both Web AR and React Native AR. He preferred React Native AR over
				Unity for accessibility reasons.
			</p>
			<p>
				When considering potential internship companies outside CF, Chazz looked for
				certain criteria: avoiding page-building WordPress practices, targeting medium to
				large-sized companies, and seeking exciting projects. Some of the companies he
				considered were Voorhoede, Dept, Mirabeau, Grrr, and BuildIn Amsterdam.
