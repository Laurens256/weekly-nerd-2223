Screen size has changed a lot over time. From 640x480 to 800x600 to 1024x768.

## Ways of interacting with the web: 
* Voice
* Eye tracking
* touch
* Mouse
* remote
* pen
* braille

User networks and conditions vary widely: wifi, hardline, mobile. The web experience is not homogenous as we imagined it to be. Lower class devices perfom worse than higher class ones. When developing for the web, we should consider all of these things.

## How can we make our websites work for everyone
Progressive enhancement / graceful degradation (escalator can never break)
Consider device / network capabilities



## Steps
* Focus on what matters
* Write it out, then read it back
* Use semantic code
* Use design to communicate your intent
* Consider your design choices and how they impact user experience
* Think about the different ways people might interact with your site
* iterate!!!!!!!!!!!
