Aaron is the Principal Accessibility Innovation Strategist at Microsoft. In this college, he discusses accessibility for the web and how to make websites work for everyone.

## Ways of interacting with the web: 
* Voice
* Eye tracking
* touch
* Mouse
* remote
* pen
* braille

User networks and conditions vary widely: wifi, hardline, mobile. The web experience is not homogenous as we imagined it to be. Lower class devices perfom worse than higher class ones. When developing for the web, we should consider all of these things.

## How can we make our websites work for everyone
To make your website more accessible, we should always apply progressive enhancement / graceful degradation. This means that we should always start with the most basic functionality and then add on to it. Developing this way ensures that the basic functionality of the website will work for anyone, only making the site more pleasurable for those with more advanced devices. A very common metaphor for this is the escalator. The escalator is a great example of progressive enhancement. The escalator is always working, even if it is not moving. If the escalator breaks, it will still work as a staircase. This is the same for well made websites. If for example, Javascript is not enabled, the website will still work, it just might not be as pleasurable.


## Steps when developing for the web
<!-- * Focus on what matters
* Write it out, then read it back
* Use semantic code
* Use design to communicate your intent
* Consider your design choices and how they impact user experience
* Think about the different ways people might interact with your site
* iterate!!!!!!!!!!! -->

1. Focus on what matters: It's important to prioritize what's most important for your website and focus on those elements first. This will help you stay on track and reduce unnecessary complexity.

2. Write it out, then read it back: Before diving into coding, take some time to plan out your website and write out your ideas. Then, read your plan back to make sure everything makes sense and you haven't missed anything important or overcomplicated things.

3. Use semantic code: Semantic code uses HTML tags that accurately describe the content they contain, making it easier for all users to understand and use your website.

4. Use design to communicate your intent: Good design can help communicate the purpose and message of your website to visitors. Use common design patterns and make sure your design conveys your intent.

5. Consider your design choices and how they impact user experience: Design choices can have a big impact on how users interact with your site. Think about things like layout, color choices and typography. Think about how these elements of a website can affect usability and accessibility.

6. Think about the different ways people might interact with your site: People will access your site from a variety of devices and browsers with varying network speeds. Make sure your site is responsive and accessible on different platforms.

7. Iterate: Finally, remember that development is an iterative process. Don't be afraid to kill your darlings and improve your site as you go.
