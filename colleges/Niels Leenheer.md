## Project Fugu
Fugu is a project designed to close the gap between native- and web applications-> kind of an improvement over electron.

An example where Fugu comes in handy is the file system access api. This api allows you to access the file system of the user. Usually for web applications this is not possible, because of security reasons. However, with this api you can access the file system of the user. This is very useful for applications like text editors, image editors, etc. This makes a web version of Photoshop possible, not possible few years ago.

### Talking with hardware examples
* Printing a receipt
* Reading a barcode
* Opening the cash drawer
* More small stuff like this

Is this safe? Niels thinks so. When using a browser, by default, nothing is allowed. You have to explicitly allow the browser to access the hardware or specific functionality. When using a native app however, everything is allowed and is hard / impossible to control. Niels says it's a bigger risk for a web app to download a native app and use that to access the hardware, than it would be for a web app to access the hardware directly.

## Demo examples
* Changing the color of a lamp
* Taking a picture with a (fake) gameboy camera
* Auto hrrrrrrrmmmm hrrmmmmmmmmmm
* Balls
* Droon :3
