				<h1>Progressive web apps</h1>
				<small>Laurens Duin - June 2023</small>

			<p>
				In today's digital landscape, with more devices, platforms, and browsers than
				ever, it keeps getting harder to build a seamless user experience for all users.
				Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) have emerged as a powerful solution, combining the
				best of web- and native applications. In this article, we will discuss the
				benefits and features of PWAs, like offline capabilities, push notifications, and
				app-like experiences.
			</p>

			<h2>Benefits of PWAs:</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Offline Capabilities: One of the standout features of PWAs is their ability to
					function offline or with limited connectivity. PWAs can leverage service workers
					to cache essential resources, allowing users to access content and perform tasks
					even when offline. This feature significantly enhances user convenience,
					especially in areas with unreliable internet access.
				</li>

				<li>
					Improved performance: Though this is not a feature exclusive to PWAs, it is
					worth mentioning that PWAs are designed to be fast and responsive, providing a
					smooth user experience. By leveraging techniques like caching, preloading, and
					efficient resource management, PWAs reduce loading times and offer a snappy
					interface, rivaling native applications.
				</li>

				<li>
					Cross-Platform Compatibility: Unlike native apps, which require separate
					development for each platform, PWAs are built using web technologies such as
					HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This enables developers to create a single codebase
					that works seamlessly across multiple platforms, including desktops,
					smartphones, tablets and anything that runs a (modern) browser.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				To show a simple example of how service workers can be used to implement offline
				functionality, take a look at the code below.
			</p>

			<pre>
				<code class="language-javascript">
const offlineCacheName = 'offline';
const offlineCacheFiles = [
	'/main.css',
	'/offline.html',
	'/manifest.json',
	'/fonts/pokemon-fire-red.woff2',
	'/img/favicon.png',
];

self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
	event.waitUntil(
		(async () => {
			const cache = await caches.open(offlineCacheName);
			await cache.addAll(offlineCacheFiles);
		})()
	);
});


self.addEventListener('fetch', async (event) => {
	event.respondWith(
		fetch(event.request)
			.then((response) => {
				return response;
			})
			.catch(async () => {
				// If there's no network, serve the cached response
				const response = await caches.match(event.request);
				if (response) {
					return response;
				} else {
					// If there's no cached response, serve the fallback HTML page
					return caches.match('/offline.html');
				}
			})
	);
});
					
				</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				Now, this code is a pretty simple example which serves a static fallback page if
				there's no connectivity. However, much more advanced service-workers can be
				written. Certain websites could even be almost entirely functional without an
				internet connection.
			</p>

			<h2>Features of PWAs:</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>
					App-Like User Interface: PWAs emulate the look and feel of native applications,
					offering users a familiar and intuitive interface. They can be added to the home
					screen, launched with a single tap, and run in full-screen mode, providing an
					immersive app-like experience.
				</li>

				<li>
					Push Notifications: PWAs can use the Push API to send push notifications to
					users, even when the PWA is not actively running. Though I would find it very
					annoying to get push notifications from a website, it's still a feature greedy
					corporations like.
				</li>

				<li>
					Offline Data Synchronization: PWAs can synchronize data in the background,
					ensuring that user data is up to date and consistent across devices. When the
					device comes back online, any changes made offline are automatically synced,
					providing a seamless transition between online and offline modes.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

			<p>
				Progressive Web Apps have opened up new possibilities for interacting on the web,
				blurring the lines between web and native experiences. With their offline
				capabilities, push notifications, and app-like interfaces, PWAs offer users an
				engaging and reliable experience, regardless of their internet connectivity. As
				more businesses and developers embrace PWAs, we can expect to see a new era of web
				applications that combine the best features of both worlds. After a smaller
				assignment I did using PWAs, I wasn't fully convinced of the benefits of PWAs.
				However, after writing this article and diving into the subject a bit more, I have
				come to appreciate the benefits of PWAs. I think this is a technology that will
				become more and more important in the future.
