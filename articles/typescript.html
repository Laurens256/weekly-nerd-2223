				<h1>Typescript Vs. Javascript</h1>
				<small>Laurens Duin - June 2023</small>
			</header>

			<p>
				Javascript and TypeScript are two prominent programming languages widely used for
				web development. Even though Typescript is a superset of Javascript, the
				differences between them couldn't be bigger. While Javascript is a dynamically
				typed language, TypeScript introduces static typing to (in my opninion) enhance
				code quality and scalability.
			</p>

			<h2>Static typing</h2>
			<p>
				As stated, the main difference between Javascript and Typescript is their typing
				system. But what exactly does static typing mean. In short; when a variable is
				assigned a type e.g. <code>string</code>, <code>number</code>,
				<code>string[]</code> etc. this type is not allowed to be changed later on in the
				code. Allow me to clarify with an example.
			</p>
			<h3>In Javascript</h3>

			<pre>
					<code class="language-javascript">
let myNumber = 10;
console.log(myNumber); // Result: 10

myNumber = "Hello!";
console.log(myNumber); // Result: Hello!
					</code>
				</pre>
			<p>
				In this example, the type our variable <code>myNumber</code> starts out as a
				number. However, because Javascript is dynamically typed, it allows us to change
				this data type to whatever we like, in this case a string.
			</p>

			<h3>In Typescript</h3>
			<p>
				In Typescript, this works a little differently. Since Typescript is statically
				typed, it means the data type of variables can't be changed after assignment. So
				the same code example from above, but in Typescript would result in the following
				TypeError.
			</p>
			<pre>
					<code class="language-typescript">
let myNumber = 10;
console.log(myNumber); // Result: 10

myNumber = "Hello!";  // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
console.log(myNumber);
					</code>
				</pre>
			<p>
				Now depending on your <code>tsconfig</code> (Typescript config), your code could
				still be ran, since any valid Javascript is valid in Typescript. However, most
				often it's better to abide by the Typescript laws and change your code. A way to
				make the above code run is by giving our variable two possible types using a colon
				like so:
			</p>
			<pre>
					<code class="language-typescript">
let myNumberOrString: number | string = 10;
console.log(myNumber); // Result: 10

myNumber = "Hello!";
console.log(myNumber); // Result: Hello!
					</code>
				</pre>

			<h2>Typescript interfaces</h2>
			<p>
				TypeScript interfaces are a fundamental feature that allows developers to define
				the structure and shape of objects. They describe the properties, their types, and
				whether they are required or optional. Interfaces enable type checking for larger
				datasets, ensuring that objects adhere to a specific structure and providing early
				detection of potential errors.
			</p>

			<h3>Use cases</h3>
			<p>
				In the simpler examples provided above, our Typescript doesn't really help us all
				that much. Where Typescript really becomes useful is when working on larger
				projects, especially ones with external data sources. To view some more advanced
				Typescript code, check out
				<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Laurens256/web-app-from-scratch-2223"
					>this project</a
				>
				or take a look at <a href="https://laurensduin.nl/">my portfolio</a> ;);
			</p>

			<h3>Function signatures</h3>
			<p>
				Finally, what I love about Typescript is how the code documents itself. What I
				mean by this is because of the strict type system, the code knows in advance what
				the paramaters, return types atc. are going to be. Provided you're using a code
				editor with Typescript intellisense, this documentation is shown on hover. For
				example, when hovering over a function call, a return value and the types of
				parameters will be specief.
			</p>

			<p>
				TypeScript also supports optional and default parameters, which further enhance
				self-documentation. By marking certain parameters as optional or providing default
				values, the function signature communicates that those parameters are not required
				for every function call. Just like in Javascript, default paramaters can also be
				set, which effectively makes the parameter optional.
			</p>

			<p>
				By utilizing these TypeScript features, functions become self-documented,
				providing clear guidelines on parameter types, return types, and optional/default
				behaviors. This enables better understanding, collaboration, and maintenance of
				codebases, as developers can rely on the self-documented functions to accurately
				represent their expected behavior.
			</p>

			<h2>To close off...</h2>
			<p>To full document all things great about Typescript, you could write a complete book. To keep things summarily though, I will leave it at this. If you're interested to learn more about Typescript, buy my course for only â‚¬700 (results not guaranteed).</p>
