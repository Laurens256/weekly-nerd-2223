				<h1>Typescript Vs. Javascript</h1>
				<small>Laurens Duin - June 2023</small>
			</header>

			<p>
				JavaScript and TypeScript are two prominent programming languages widely used for
				web development. Even though Typescript is a superset of Javascript, the
				differences between them couldn't be bigger. While JavaScript is a dynamically
				typed language, TypeScript introduces static typing to (in my opninion) enhance
				code quality and scalability.

				<h2>Static typing</h2>
				<p>
					As stated, the main difference between Javascript and Typescript is their typing
					system. But what exactly does static typing mean. In short; when a variable is
					assigned a type e.g. <code>string</code>, <code>number</code>,
					<code>string[]</code> etc. this type is not allowed to be changed later on in
					the code. Allow me to clarify with an example.
				</p>
				<pre>
<h3>In Javascript:</h3>
<code class="language-javascript">
let myNumner = 10;
console.log(typeof myNumner); // Result: number

myNumner = "Hello!";
console.log(typeof myNumner); // Result: string
</code>
				</pre>
				<p>
					In this example, the type our variable <code>myNumber</code> starts out as a
					number. However, because Javascript is dynamically typed, it allows us to change
					this data type to whatever we like, in this case a string.
