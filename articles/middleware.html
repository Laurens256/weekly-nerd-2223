				<h1>Using middleware in Express.js</h1>
				<small>Laurens Duin - June 2023</small>
			</header>

			<p>
				Express.js (from now on referred to as Express) is a cool framework that helps in
				making web applications using Node.js. One of the things I like most in Express is
				middleware. This paper gives a basic understanding of what middleware is and how
				it works in Express. We'll talk about the different types of middleware and their
				functions. I'll also showcase some of my own custom middleware which has helped me
				in projects.
			</p>

			<div>
				<h2>Introduction to middleware</h2>
				<p>
					Middleware acts as a bridge between the server and the application. It allows
					for the execution of additional functionalities during the processing of HTTP
					requests. It provides a layer of code that can intercept requests, modify them,
					and perform various tasks such as authentication, data validation, logging, and
					error handling. This layer greatly improves the functionality, flexibility, and
					reusability of web applications.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2>Understanding middleware</h2>
				<p>
					Express.js middleware functions as a series of functions that are executed
					sequentially during the processing of an HTTP request. Each middleware function
					has access to the request object (req), response object (res), and a next
					function, which allows the request to proceed to the next middleware in line.
					There are three main types of middleware in Express.js:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Application-level middleware: This middleware is bound to the entire
						application and is executed for every incoming request. It can be used for
						tasks like setting up headers, parsing request bodies, or performing
						authentication checks.
					</li>

					<li>
						Router-level middleware: This middleware is applied to specific routes or
						groups of routes using Express.js routers. It allows for handling specific
						requests differently based on the defined middleware. For example, it can
						handle authorization for certain routes or apply specific validations.
					</li>

					<li>
						Error handling middleware: This middleware is used to handle errors that occur
						during the request-response cycle. It provides a centralized mechanism to
						catch and handle errors. It is typically placed at the end of the middleware
						stack and can generate appropriate error responses for each different error.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					By using these different types of middleware appropriately, your code can become
					much more consisten, scalable and maintainable.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2>Benefits of middleware</h2>
				<p>
					Middleware in Express.js offers several advantages that contribute to efficient
					web application development:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Modularity and reusability: Middleware promotes modularity by allowing
						developers to split their application logic into smaller, self-contained
						middleware functions. This modular approach makes code more reusable, as
						middleware functions can be applied to multiple routes or shared across
						different applications.
					</li>
					<li>
						Simplified request and response handling: Middleware simplifies the handling
						of incoming requests and outgoing responses. Developers can use middleware to
						perform common tasks such as parsing request data, modifying headers, or
						validating inputs. This streamlines the development process and avoids
						repetitive code in individual route handlers.
					</li>
					<li>
						Authentication and authorization: Middleware plays a crucial role in
						implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms in web applications.
						By placing authentication middleware before the route handlers, developers can
						easily verify user identities and control access to specific routes or
						resources, ensuring only authenticated users can access protected areas.
					</li>

					<li>
						Enhanced error handling and logging: Middleware allows for centralized error
						handling and logging. Error handling middleware can catch and process errors,
						providing consistent error responses to clients. Additionally, middleware can
						be used for logging requests, responses, and application events, facilitating
						debugging and monitoring processes.
					</li>

					<li>
						Improved code organization: Middleware enables better code organization by
						separating concerns and promoting a clean structure. Developers can group
						related functionalities into middleware functions, making the codebase more
						organized, readable, and maintainable. This modular approach also facilitates
						code reuse and encourages a more systematic development workflow.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

				<h2>Custom middleware</h2>
				<p>
					To finish of this article, I would like to showcase some of my own custom
					middleware. These middleware aren't necessarily the most complicated or
					innovative but they've made my Express projects more scalable and pleasurable to
					work on.
				</p>

				<div>
					<h3>Head data middleware</h3>
					<p>
						The following code is some middleware that I use in most of my Express
						projects. This middleware sets the right data inside
						<code>res.locals</code> for each route. Data inside
						<code>res.locals</code> will be available inside the
						<code>res.render</code> function of the route handler.
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-javascript">
import { findRoute } from '../helpers/findRoute.js';

const setHeadData = async (req, res, next) => {
	const match = await findRoute(req.originalUrl);

	res.locals.head = data[match.route.path] ?? data.fallback;

	next();
};

const data = {
	'/new-project': {
		title: 'New Project | Appclusive',
		description: '',
		scripts: ['createProject'],
	},
	'/project/:projectId': {
		title: 'Checklist',
		description: '',
		scripts: ['checklist', 'projectinfo'],
	},
	fallback: {
		title: 'Whoopsy',
		description: 'whoops',
		scripts: [],
	},
};

export { setHeadData };
</code></pre>
				</div>

				<div>
					<h3>Set cache headers</h3>
					<p>The code below is taken from my server side rendere Pok√©dex project. This middleware checks any outgoing requests, if the request URL contains a substring, in this case pokemon, cache-control headers with a max-age are set to the request. For this specific example, this specific request is cached for 1 day.</p>
					<pre><code class="language-typescript">
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';

const setCacheHeaders = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
	const timeInSeconds = 60 * 60 * 24; // 1 day

	if (req.method == 'GET' && req.path.includes('pokemon')) {
		res.set('Cache-control', `public, max-age=${timeInSeconds}`);
	}

	next();
};

export { setCacheHeaders };
</code></pre>
