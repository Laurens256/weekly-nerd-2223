			<p>
				This week, I visited the
				<a href="https://nxtmuseum.com/" target="_blank">Nxt museum</a> in Amsterdam for
				the first time. The Nxt is a media museum which
				<em>"challenges assumptions and open minds."</em> A lot of exhibitions are in some
				way interactive. Some interactions are very explicit, for example by using a
				controller you move a character through a surreal level based on heaven / hell.
				Other interactions are more implicit, for example walking by a sensor to add a
				filter to a video of the room.
			</p>

			<p>
				The exhibition that spoke to me the most is "Foreign Nature" by
				<a href="http://www.julius-horsthuis.com/" target="_blank">Julius Horsthuis</a>.
				This exhibit features a large room where very trippy / cool videos are projected
				on the walls and floor. To the side of the room, were benches from where you could
				observe the room in full. The room was otherwise dark, so my full attention was on
				the videos. This made the room feel very surreal. The videos were very trippy, it
				kind of felt like a fever dream.

				<h2>Technical analysis</h2>
				<p>
					As I was watching these surreal images flicker before my eyes, I wondered how
					this was even possible and how the images flowed into each other so smoothly.
					Upon looking at the ceiling, I realized this was <em>simply</em> done with one
					or multiple projectors. The reason I say one or multiple is because it wasn't
					entirely clear to me if some of the devices on the ceiling were just lights or
					projectors. At the very least, there's one big central projector which is
					responsible for projecting the images onto the floor. The smaller projectors (or
					lights) might be responsible for projecting the images onto the walls but I
					wouldn't know for sure.
				</p>

				<p>
					globally Now, when I sat in that room, I thought "wow someone spent a crazy
					amount of time modeling all this". After some research however, I found out that
					the video was actually generated by using code. The artist, Julius Horsthuis, is
					a VFX artist who uses fractals to create his art.

				<p>
					Fractals are fascinating mathematical objects that exhibit self-similarity at
					different scales. In simpler words, they have patterns that repeat themselves no
					matter how much you zoom in or out. Fractals are created using mathematical
					equations or algorithms. This is what makes fractals so interesting for 3D art.
					You can create a fractal and zoom in on it infinitely and you will always see
					new details while maintaining a level of similarity. I think this is why the
					video feels so surreal. It's because it's not based on anything real but rather
					a mathematical equation. It's like looking at a dream.

					The object need not exhibit exactly the same structure at all scales, but the
					same “type” of structures must appear on all scales. -
