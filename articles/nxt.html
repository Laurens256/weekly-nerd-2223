			<p>
				This week, I visited the
				<a href="https://nxtmuseum.com/" target="_blank">Nxt museum</a> in Amsterdam for
				the first time. The Nxt is a media museum which
				<em><q>challenges assumptions and open minds.</q></em> A lot of exhibitions are in
				some way interactive. Some interactions are very explicit, for example by using a
				controller you move a character through a surreal level based on heaven / hell.
				Other interactions are more implicit, for example walking by a sensor to add a
				filter to a video of the room.
			</p>

			<p>
				The exhibition that spoke to me the most was a large room where very trippy / cool
				videos were projected on the walls and floor. To the side of the room, were
				benches from where you could observe the room in full. The room was otherwise
				dark, so my full attention was on the videos. This made the room feel very
				surreal. The videos were very trippy, it kind of felt like a fever dream.

					As I was watching these surreal images flicker before my eyes, I wondered how this was even possible and how the images flowed into each other so smoothly.
