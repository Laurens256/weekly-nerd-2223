## 3D
When building a 3D scene on the web, we often use the HTML `<canvas>` element. The canvas element, much like a real world canvas, can be used to paint specific pixels.

### WebGL
WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics without the use of plug-ins. WebGL is integrated completely into all the web standards of the browser allowing GPU accelerated usage of physics and image processing and effects as part of the web page canvas.

## Cameras
Perspective camera, orthographic camera.

## Lights
Ambient light, directional light, point light, spot light.

## Webgpu
Webgpu is a newer, better version of WebGL. It is currently in development and not yet supported by a lot of browsers.

## WebXR
WebXR is a technology used to make websites for VR and AR devices. Like Webgpu, it is still in development and not yet supported by a lot of browsers.
