# 3D & Three.js

Servin works for Level 30 Wizards, a creative digital studio, as the lead frontend developer. Where needed he also works as a fullstack developer. In this college, he talks about 3D on the web and Three.js.

In the context of 3D and web development, the HTML `<canvas>` element is commonly used to build 3D scenes by painting specific pixels.

WebGL is a JavaScript API that allows rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics directly in web browsers, eliminating the need for plugins. It seamlessly integrates with web standards and enables GPU-accelerated physics, image processing, and effects within the web page canvas.

Different types of cameras can be used in 3D scenes, such as the perspective camera and orthographic camera.

Various types of lights can be implemented to enhance the 3D scene, including ambient light, directional light, point light, and spot light.

WebGPU is a newer and improved version of WebGL that is still in development. It offers enhanced capabilities but is not widely supported by browsers yet.

WebXR is a technology aimed at creating websites for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices. Similar to WebGPU, it is still in development and not widely supported by browsers at present.
