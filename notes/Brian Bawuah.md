Prototyping for virtual reality:
- Start by prototyping on whiteboard / paper
- Brownboxing prototype: cardboard, paper, arduino
- Prototyping using Blender
- How do you convert this to the web?
	- HTML canvas element
	- Three.js (javascript library)

Ready player me => third party software to generate avatar based on picture

UDP protocol keeps sending packets, regardless of if or when they arrive at the destination. This is useful for real-time applications, like video games. -->

Brian is an employee at Rockstars IT and is involved in virtual reality prototyping. 

The prototyping process begins with initial sketches on whiteboards or paper. Then, Brian creates a cardboard or paper prototype using Arduino, and also utilizes Blender for further prototyping. When it comes to converting the prototype to a web-based format, Brian suggests using the HTML canvas element or the Three.js JavaScript library.

To generate (3D) avatars, Brian uses a service called Ready Player Me, a third-party software that generates avatars based on a user's picture. This tool can be helpful for creating personalized virtual representations.

Furthermore, Brian explains the significance of the UDP (User Datagram Protocol) protocol in real-time applications, such as video games. UDP sends packets continuously, irrespective of whether they reach the destination or when they do so. This constant transmission is beneficial for maintaining real-time interaction. I didn't really get this part but he seemed passionate about it :)
