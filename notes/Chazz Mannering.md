Chazz Mannering is 26 years old. He completed his pre-university education (HAVO) and then pursued a 1-year course in ICT before enrolling in CMD (Communication and Multimedia Design). He jokingly refers to himself as having "eternal student syndrome."

Chazz started his journey at CMD in 2017 and completed all the available tech tracks. In the meantime, he worked as a Frontend Developer. CF, which stands for Data-driven Design & Technology Consultancy, focuses on unraveling the complexities of the world through data, design, and technology. Chazz contributed to the creation of a Corona Dashboard and gained experience in data visualization and data-driven experiences.

CF has a team of 40 employees with various disciplines, including data analysts, frontend developers, designers, and UX specialists. Weekly team meetings and tech/design reviews are conducted. Their tech stack primarily involves React and Next for frontend development.

At CF, Chazz started by taking a one-week React Course. He then worked on various projects such as the prototype day gallery, artmile AR, Globalance, Experiments page, Powers of Ten, and Patterns of Cairo. The prototype day is an annual internal project, similar to a hackathon, where participants receive a task and spend the entire day working on it.

Chazz conducted extensive testing for the use of Augmented Reality (AR) on the web, exploring both Web AR and React Native AR. He preferred React Native AR over Unity for accessibility reasons.

When considering potential internship companies outside CF, Chazz looked for certain criteria: avoiding page-building WordPress practices, targeting medium to large-sized companies, and seeking exciting projects. Some of the companies he considered were Voorhoede, Dept, Mirabeau, Grrr, and BuildIn Amsterdam.

Chazz offers some tips for internships:

1. Know yourself.
2. Stay open to new technologies.
3. Engage in discussions with colleagues about design and technology, as both parties can learn from each other.
4.If you have interesting projects or ideas, present them to your colleagues.
